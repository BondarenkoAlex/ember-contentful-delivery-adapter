            <h3>Short Courses</h3>
            <p>General cooking courses cover a wide range of topics and range in length from just a few short units, to
                more comprehensive courses that can be followed over several weeks or even months. It's all up to you
                and your schedule. A great place to start if you are new is with our sample course, just so you can get
                a feel for our courses. These courses are included in our general membership plan.</p>
