                <p>Designed for the home chef, Kitchen Window's Cooking School offers a variety of cooking classes on
                    everything from the basics to gourmet. Some of our series include: The Fundamentals of Cooking,
                    Baking Seminars, Market Tours, Global Cuisine, Meet the Chef, Grilling and Outdoor Entertaining,
                    Young Chef Classes, and Special Events. There is truly something for everyone..</p>

                <p>The goal of the program is to go beyond just teaching a recipe. We strive to teach you about the
                    tools, skills and techniques involved in the cooking process so that the knowledge learned can be
                    applied to cooking as a whole. Once you master the techniques, you can use your creativity to
                    confidently develop your own dishes.</p>
